= Spring Boot Example Issues Repository
:author: Salvatore Bernardo

This repository contains a collection of example projects that reproduce specific issues related to Spring Boot 3.2.x. Each directory represents a unique issue with Spring Boot 3.2.x. The issues span a variety of Spring's features and modules, from Bean lifecycle management, complex transactions, to REST controllers, among others.

== Repository Structure

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to an identifiable issue.
Each directory contains an isolated, self-containing Spring Boot application and can be run independently.
Inside each sub-directory, you will find the source code along with a separate README that details the specific issue, how to reproduce it, and potential ways to resolve or workarounds.

== Running the Examples

Every subdirectory is set up as a Maven project and can be run from the command line with mvn spring-boot:run or directly from an IDE with Spring Tools Suite (STS) installed.
NOTE: Ensure you have JDK 21 and Maven 3.6+ installed to be able to run the examples.
